This dataset contains 10,003 images that have been classified into 3 different sets (Training, Validation, and Test). The ratio in which they have been spilt is 3:1:1. Out of the 5003 images that contain fire, 2,567 images have been synthetically generated by superimposing images of fire on videos of roads in Singapore.
